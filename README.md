# My Personal Project

## Project *Ombre*

This term, I intend to combine my interests of storytelling,
game design, and coding to create a **text-based adventure
game**. Users will interact with a very simple interface that
prints information and descriptions in response to their
input, and they will be tasked with learning and utilizing
**magical spells** to survive an encounter with a sinister *mage noir*. 

Users would play this game for entertainment, of course, and
to explore an engaging fantasy setting I have constructed.
However, I am a big believer in the **educational potential of 
video games**, so this project will have a unique beneficial 
twist. Simply put, the spells that players will be learning
must be cast by speaking (or typing) a special incantation in
an **ancient language** that just so happens to be identical to
our world's French. So, while users would 
primarily play this program for fun, there is an opportunity
for them to pick up **French vocabulary** and interesting verbs
in a new, engaging way!

### Specific Feature Goals
- Large potential for **replayability** in the form of an arcane time manipulation device
- Randomized loot-table-like behaviour when learning spells
- **Enemy** & **combat** mechanics
- A puzzle within the story

I am **very aware** that this idea is quite ambitious in scope. 
Keeping in mind the fact that I do have prior experience
coding in Java and building games, I still intend to **closely
monitor** my progress throughout the term, and find ways to
reduce my plan slightly should the need arise. For example, I 
would be willing to lower the objective to a simple story game,
without combat mechanics or spells to learn, if my intentions
shift from creating something that interests me to ensuring I
have a minimum viable product. 

### Requirements
Regardless of whether I complete the full vision of my project 
or reduce it to a simpler story game, there will be numerous
systems that fulfill the basic requirements set out
by this assignment *(a custom class X and another class Y that 
consists of a collection of X)*. For
example, the different scenes of the story could be class X, and
the class that stores all of them and decides which one to display
based on the user input could be Y. Each spell object could be
considered X, and the player will have to learn them one at a time
and add them to an inventory-like collection that could be Y. 


### User Stories
There are actually two different kinds of users for this program: *creators* and *players*. 

*As a user, I would like to be able to...*

- ~~become immersed in a dangerous high-stakes espionage mission within a custom-built fantasy world~~
- have fun mastering the combat system and learning how to guide the story towards a goal
- ~~explore the possible actions and objects of interest within the game through natural text prompts~~
- understand the overarching story between multiple runs of the game
- ~~become invested in defeating the enemy by learning more~~
- ~~add arcane spells to a list of possible abilities they can utilize throughout the story~~
- learn the effects of each spell and experiment with the keywords to build a rudimentary understanding 
of some French vocabulary
- utilize the fact that the game resets upon death to jump into preparing for the next battle
- win the game in around 5-8 runs, depending on effort put in

*As a creator, I would like to be able to...*
- ~~Add distinct Scenes to a central, interconnecting storyline in the form of simple, intuitive Json files~~
- ~~Chain Scenes together in the Json files using simple and efficient encoded event objects~~
- ~~Populate Scenes with conditions and events that create an emergent exploration mechanic~~
