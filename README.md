# My Personal Project

## Project *Ombre*

This term, I intend to combine my interests of storytelling,
game design, and coding to create a **text-based adventure
game**. Users will interact with a very simple interface that
prints information and descriptions in response to their
input, and they will be tasked with learning and utilizing
**magical spells** to survive an encounter with a sinister *mage noir*. 

Users would play this game for entertainment, of course, and
to explore an engaging fantasy setting I have constructed.
However, I am a big believer in the **educational potential of 
video games**, so this project will have a unique beneficial 
twist. Simply put, the spells that players will be learning
must be cast by speaking (or typing) a special incantation in
an **ancient language** that just so happens to be identical to
our world's French. So, while users would 
primarily play this program for fun, there is an opportunity
for them to pick up **French vocabulary** and interesting verbs
in a new, engaging way!

### Specific Feature Goals
- Large potential for **replayability** in the form of an arcane time manipulation device
- Randomized loot-table-like behaviour when learning spells
- **Enemy** & **combat** mechanics
- A puzzle within the story

I am **very aware** that this idea is quite ambitious in scope. 
Keeping in mind the fact that I do have prior experience
coding in Java and building games, I still intend to **closely
monitor** my progress throughout the term, and find ways to
reduce my plan slightly should the need arise. For example, I 
would be willing to lower the objective to a simple story game,
without combat mechanics or spells to learn, if my intentions
shift from creating something that interests me to ensuring I
have a minimum viable product. 

### Requirements
Regardless of whether I complete the full vision of my project 
or reduce it to a simpler story game, there will be numerous
systems that fulfill the basic requirements set out
by this assignment *(a custom class X and another class Y that 
consists of a collection of X)*. For
example, the different scenes of the story could be class X, and
the class that stores all of them and decides which one to display
based on the user input could be Y. Each spell object could be
considered X, and the player will have to learn them one at a time
and add them to an inventory-like collection that could be Y. 


### User Stories
*As a user, I would like to be able to...*

- ~~explore the possible actions and objects of interest within the game~~
- ~~input natural text prompts and receive feedback about them dynamically~~
- ~~Maneuver between different locations in-game and investigate objects between them~~
- ~~add arcane spells to a list of possible tools to use later~~
- play the game multiple times in a row and understand the overarching story
- utilize collected spells to engage in a combat encounter against an enemy
- utilize collected spells/items to unlock features in the story
- load data from a file when the application starts, and be prompted with the option to save data to file when the application ends
- ~~save the state of the entire game to a data file at any point I choose, using the savegame keyword~~
- ~~be presented with the choice to resume a saved game from the data file when the program starts~~
- ~~learn about a custom-build fantasy world in a dangerous high-stakes espionage mission~~
- learn the effects of each spell and experiment with the keywords to build a rudimentary understanding
  of some French vocabulary

### Instructions for Grader

**First Required Action (adding Xs to Y):** Type "go to desk" into the interface, 
then "search bookshelves" to find a spell.

**Second Required Action (viewing details of X):** Click on the button with the 
fireball label to open the spells menu, then click a spell to learn 
more about it.

**Visual Component:** Visual components for the buttons can be found in the data/images folder.

**Saving & Loading:** The player will be prompted with the option
to save upon closing the application. They can also use the button
labelled with a save icon. If a save file already exists, the player
will be prompted with the option to load upon starting the application.
