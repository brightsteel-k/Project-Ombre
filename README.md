# My Personal Project

## The *Ars d'Ombre*

This term, I intend to combine my interests of storytelling,
game design, and coding to create a simple text-based adventure
game. Users will interact with a very simple interface that
prints information and descriptions in response to their
input, and they will be tasked with learning and utilizing
spells to survive an encounter with a sinister mage. 

Users would play this game for entertainment, of course, and
to explore an engaging fantasy setting I have constructed.
However, I am a big believer in the educational potential of 
video games, so this project will have a unique beneficial 
twist. Simply put, the spells that players will be learning
must be cast by speaking (or typing) a special incantation in
an ancient language that just so happens to be identical to
our world's language of French. So, while users would 
primarily play this program for fun, there is an opportunity
for them to pick up French vocabulary and interesting verbs
in a new, engaging way!

Some specific features I'd like to include follow:
- Large potential for replayability in the form of an arcane time manipulation device
- Randomized loot-table-like behaviour when learning spells
- Enemy battle mechanics
- Puzzles

I am **very aware** that this idea is quite broad in scope. 
Keeping in mind the fact that I do have prior experience
coding in Java and building games, I still intend to **closely
monitor** my progress throughout the term, and find ways to
reduce my plan slightly should the need arise.
